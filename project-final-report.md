## Code Overview

Code for the Canjam project is organized into three main directories:

1. The root directory, which contains the driver script `run.py`
2. The `canjam/` directory, which contains the bulk of the Canjam code
3. The `tests/` directory, which contains a number of unit test files which can
  be run using the instructions in the [testing](#testing) section
