# CONCURRENCY FINAL PROJECT: [ NAME ]

## 1. Team Name

What is your team name? (Keep it relatively short, clean, and free of embedded spaces or other special characters. â€” we'll use this internally for grading.)

Our team name is JamCan.

## 2. Group Members
Our members are Skylar, Tyler, Cece, and Roger.

## 3. Project

A collaborative canvas where users can share musical sounds with each other, in
real time, using an intuitive UI. The interface will be built using PyGame and
the rest of the application will be in Python.

## 4. Minimum and Maximum Deliverable

Minimum: A GUI-based program that displays a 2D grid for playing collaborative
music. The grid represents pitches on the x-axis and velocities on the y-axis.
When a client clicks on a part of the grid, they and all others in that grid's
room will hear a corresponding note. Multiple clients will be able to join a
"room," in which a single grid exists. Multiple clients can play music by
clicking and dragging over the grid. When one client plays sound by clicking on
the grid, all clients in the room will hear the note.

Maximum: We would extend the canvas app with a bevy of features:

- Clients may play drum loops in the room.
- Clients may record jam sessions and export the recorded sessions to a file.
- If the client hosting a room dies, another client automatically becomes the
host; this is made possible through our peer-to-peer architecture.
- Add ripples, delay, envelope, and other graphical or musical sparkles. 

## 5. First Steps

What's your first step?

Our first step is to develop a PTP architecture model for our application. On
our own, we will learn PyGame or another Python GUI package so we can start
programming swiftly. and After completing a formal initial design, we will begin
programming.

## 6. Biggest Problem

What's the biggest problem you foresee or question you need to answer to get started?

Designing a PTP architecture that can accommodate many users
